This repository contains code for cleaning and analyzing the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) military expenditure data from 1990-2021 using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data has been visualized with charts, and linear regression has been performed for the regions Africa, Europe, Asia & Oceania, America, and the Middle East.


The SIPRI military expenditure data was obtained from their website: https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex. This dataset contains information about military expenditure by country and region from 1990-2021. The original data was in the form of an Excel file and was cleaned using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.


The data cleaning process involved removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, handling missing values, and converting data types to make it easier to work with. The cleaned data was then saved as an EXCEL file for further analysis.


The cleaned data was analyzed using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, box plots and scatter plots. The data was also analyzed using linear regression to examine the relationship between military expenditure and time for each region.


The SIPRI data used in this repository was obtained from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute: https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex.
